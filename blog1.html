    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Shrijeet Hadap</strong>, a Mechanical Engineering student at JSPM Rajarshi Shahu College of Engineering, Tathawade.
Like many students, I once dreamed of cracking JEE and getting into an IIT. I gave it everything I had — late-night study sessions, coaching classes, mock tests — but when the results came, I didn’t get the rank I hoped for.

    <h2>My lowest point</h2>
    <p>It was hard. I felt lost, like all the effort went to waste. I questioned myself — am I even capable? Did I just waste 2 years? But slowly, I realized something important: **a single exam does not define my future.** What matters is what I do next.</p>
    <h2>Choosing new path</h2>
    <p>I joined JSPM RSCOE to pursue Mechanical Engineering. At first, I carried that JEE disappointment with me. But I decided I would give my best here and rebuild myself. I got involved in the <strong>Formula Student Team - Redline Racing</strong>, where I work in the <em>Structures domain</em>, designing components using CATIA V5, AutoCAD, and analyzing in ANSYS.</p>

        <h3>Discovering web development</h3>
        <p>Alongside mechanical work, I began exploring something new — <strong>Web Development</strong>. I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was confusing at first, but slowly I began to love it. Now, I can build landing pages, blogs, and even my own portfolio!</p></section>
        <section id="how far I have come">
            <h4>How far I have come</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Completed projects in both Mechanical and Web fields</li>
  <li>Created my portfolio website using HTML & CSS</li>
  <li>Learned CAD tools and started CFD & FEA analysis</li>
  <li>Scored a CGPA above 8 in 1st year</li>
  <li>Interned at Harihar Industries for CNC and VMC exposure</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>My message to students like me</h5>
            <p>If you didn’t crack JEE — it’s okay. That exam doesn’t decide your worth. I didn’t get into an IIT, but now I’m building skills that IITians would admire. It’s not where you start — it’s where you choose to go.</p>
            <p>
Every single day, I learn something new. And I know that by the time I graduate, I’ll be skilled, confident, and ready to create value — in tech, design, or even business.
</p>
<h3> The Journey Is Mine Now. And I’m Owning It.</h3>
