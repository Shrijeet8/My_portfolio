        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I'm Shrijeet Hadap, a passionate Mechanical Engineering student at JSPM Rajarshi Shahu College of Engineering, Pune. Currently in my first year, Iâ€™m actively exploring the intersection of engineering, design, and technology.
  </p>
  <li>Iâ€™m part of the Formula Student team (Team Red Line Racing) in the Structures domain, where I work on vehicle component design using tools like CATIA V5 and AutoCAD. Iâ€™m also diving into simulation and analysis through ANSYS, focusing on structural aspects.</li>
  <li> Beyond core engineering, Iâ€™m building strong foundations in web development (HTML, CSS) and aiming to become a well-rounded engineer with both technical and creative problem-solving skills. My goal is to contribute to impactful projects and continuously grow through hands-on learning.</li>
